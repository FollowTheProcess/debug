Like Rust's [dbg macro], but for Go!

## Project Description

`debug` provides a simple, elegant mechanism to streamline "print debugging", inspired by Rust's [dbg macro]

> [!NOTE]
> This is not intended for logging in production, more to enable quick local debugging while iterating. `debug.Debug` should **not** make it into your production code

## Installation

```shell
go get github.com/FollowTheProcess/debug@latest
```

## Quickstart

### Before

```go
package main

import "fmt"

func main() {
    something := "hello"
    fmt.Printf("something = %s\n", something)
}
```

```shell
something = something
```

- Not ideal, need to manually type variable name
- No source info, could easily get lost in a large program
- Need to deal with fmt verbs

### With `debug.Debug`

```go
package main

import "github.com/FollowTheProcess/debug"

func main() {
    something := "hello"
    debug.Debug(something)
}
```

```shell
DEBUG: [/Users/you/projects/myproject/main.go:7:3] something = "hello"
```

- Source info, yay! ðŸŽ‰
- Variable name is handled for you
- Can handle any valid go expression or value
- No fmt print verbs
